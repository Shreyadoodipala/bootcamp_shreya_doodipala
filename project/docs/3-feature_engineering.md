### Income to installment ratio
$$
\text{income\_installment\_ratio} = \frac{\text{Annual Installment Payments}}{\text{Annual Income}}
$$  
This measures the affordability of the loan relative to the borrowerâ€™s income. If this ratio is high, the borrower has more disposable income relative to loan obligations, hence lower risk.

### Debt to credit ratio
$$
\text{debt\_to\_credit\_ratio} = \frac{\text{Revolving Balance}}{\text{Annual Income}}
$$  
This measures how much revolving debt (like credit card balance that carries over) the borrower has compared to their annual income. Higher values indicate that the borrower has more debt relative to earnings, hence can be of higher risk.
